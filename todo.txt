Things to do:

- Load most recently modified file (use oswalk) [done for now]
	* need to know where data files are going to be stored
- Put multiple variables on same graph
	- legend for each graph
	* how many variables can be plotted on same axis?
- Create menu for loading file [done for now]
	- definitely in main menu - also in graph window? 

- COLOR WHEELS?!?!?!
	- normalize by center/don't normalize
	* get theta/radius calculation program from John

Reducing memory usage (Graph):
- drawing plot the first time makes deep copies of DATA_DICT entries
- reader sends signal with new row each time row is read
- something needs to parse signal to send graphs relevant data
- after initial drawing, graph plots whenever signal comes in
- windows update (graphs call draw()) every second
- build legend based on initial plot - find some way to save "artists"
	(2D lines? plots?)
