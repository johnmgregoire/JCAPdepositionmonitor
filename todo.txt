Things to do:

- Load most recently modified file (use oswalk) [done for now]
	* need to know where data files are going to be stored
- Put multiple variables on same graph
	- legend for each graph
- Create menu for loading file
	- definitely in main menu - also in graph window? 
- Clicking on data point gives info (x, y coordinates)

- COLOR WHEELS?!?!?!
	- normalize by center/don't normalize
