Things to do:

- Load most recently modified file (use oswalk) [done for now]
	* need to know where data files are going to be stored
- Create menu for loading file [done for now]
	- definitely in main menu - also in graph window? 

- COLOR WHEELS?!?!?!
	- normalize by center/don't normalize

* In our testing, we've needed to start writing to the file
before we open the program in order to read that file.
In practice, the file probably won't be created (and thus
won't be available to load)
until data is already being written anyway.
The only thing that might be messy is if a file stops being
written to for a while and then the user opens the program
before continuing writing to the file.  We should check if
this is problematic when we get the chance.
