Things we need to keep track of:

- in filename:
	- element (for title)
	- source (?)
	- power supply
	- wattage of power supply (not needed for graph)
	- tilt
	- z-positions (either one or two)

- date and time (for computing averages)
- 'Xtal2 Rate', 'Xtal3 Rate', 'Xtal4 Rate',
  'Platen Zshift Motor 1 Position','Platen Motor Position',
  'Capman Pressure', 'MFC1 Flow', 'MFC2 Flow',
  'MFC3 Flow', 'MFC4 Flow'
	- pressure and flow probably not needed for graphs
- 'platenangle_profile' is essentially rounded raw data
	from 'Platen Motor Position'
- useful indices
- process Xtal rates
- taking averages over times where tilt, z-position, radius
	is fixed
- adding color values for different elements, computing
	percentages based on sum



Clarifications:

- 'Src[src] tilt motor position' should match t-value
	in filename
	(probably throw away data set if no matches in file,
	when the time comes to think about that)
- it's alright to compute averages, plot point after gun
	has moved to next position
- as in Graph, give warning message if power is fluctuating
	and error messages if power supply is failing
	(maybe integrate this function into MainMenu, so
	the entire program is put into the background when
	there's a serious error?)
- no need to put data in library file right now
- take necessary t and z values from filename - need to ask
	if we can hard-code radius values given in process3
