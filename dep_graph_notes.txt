Things we need to keep track of:

- in filename:
	- element (for title)
	- source (?)
	- power supply
	- wattage of power supply (not needed for graph)
	- tilt
	- z-positions (either one or two)

- date and time (for computing averages)
- 'Xtal2 Rate', 'Xtal3 Rate', 'Xtal4 Rate',
  'Platen Zshift Motor 1 Position','Platen Motor Position',
  'Capman Pressure', 'MFC1 Flow', 'MFC2 Flow',
  'MFC3 Flow', 'MFC4 Flow'
	- pressure and flow probably not needed for graphs
- 'platenangle_profile' is essentially rounded raw data
	from 'Platen Motor Position'
- useful indices
- process Xtal rates
- taking averages over times where tilt, z-position, radius
	is fixed
- adding color values for different elements, computing
	percentages based on sum
